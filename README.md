# N-Queens Problem Solver

## Overview
This project implements a solution to the classic N-Queens problem — placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. 

The goal is to find all possible ways to arrange the queens such that none share the same row, column, or diagonal.
