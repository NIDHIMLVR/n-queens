# N-Queens Problem Solver

## Overview
This project implements a solution to the classic N-Queens problem — placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. 
The goal is to find all possible ways to arrange the queens such that none share the same row, column, or diagonal.This project solves the N-Queens problem using **backtracking**. It finds all possible ways to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

## Input
- The program prompts the user to enter an integer `N`, representing the size of the board and the number of queens.

## Output
- Prints all valid board configurations.
- Each configuration displays the board as a grid of `0`s and `1`s:
  - `1` indicates a queen.
  - `0` indicates an empty space.
- If no solution exists, it prints `"solution does not exist"`.

## Usage
Run the program and enter the value of `N` when prompted.
